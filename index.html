            Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
            looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
            <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to
            the documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
            iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
            capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
            platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
            of your UI using React components:
            <i> bundles of reusable, nestable code</i>. You can learn more about
            React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components
            work in React Native.

            React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for
            building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React
            Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get
            you started or can serve as a refresher course.
            <br />
            <br />
            We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
          </p>
          <ul class="section__list list">
            <li class="section__content list__element">
              <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses
              cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need
              names and a cafe to work in.
            </li>
            <li class="section__content list__element">
              <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets
              you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
              <span class="section__content section__content_highlighted">
                &lt Text &gt Hello, I am your cat!&lt Text &gt</span
              >.
            </li>
            <li class="section__content list__element">
              The React docs have <u>comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can
              refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
              variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
              <span class="section__content section__content_highlighted"
                >name</span
              >
              for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
              <span class="section__content section__content_highlighted"
                >&lt Text &gt</span
              >
            </li>
            <li class="section__content list__element">
              <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
            </li>
            <li class="section__content list__element">
              <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use
              to configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs
              personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
              changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
              your components memory!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
          <h2 class="section__title">handling text input</h2>
          <p class="section__content">
            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
            has an <i>onChangeText</i> prop that takes a function to be called
            every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes
            a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
            their words into a different language. In this new language, every
            single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
            there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
